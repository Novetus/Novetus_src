----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 v8.2022.1
Changes from 1.3 v6.2022.1:
Notes:
- If you want to use the new Mod Package Creator for the first time, make sure to use a clean, unmodified Novetus install. Any installed mods before this update will not show up in the Mod Package Creator if you install this update on top of a previous Novetus version.
- Add the list.php and delist.php files to your master server if you would like to support future 1.3 versions. 
- The query.php file is now deprecated, but it is still under the original GPL v3 license. Do NOT expect any updates for it.

Enhancements:
- Novetus will now switch to the Extended style by default under Wine due to the lack of proper WPF support.
- Logs are now stored in the "logs" directory.
- Removed the Novetus Asset Redirect due to the hosting provider taking it down.
- Removed the "Show Item Types" option from the Asset Fixer as it was deprecated by the Item SDK.
- Added better Asset Fixer error handling.
	- The Asset Fixer will now show up as "ASSETFIX" in the logs if there is an error.
- Every client now has support for custom addon scripts!
	- Addon scripts can extend Novetus functionality with the Novetus Scripting API, or just be basic scripts 
	- Add addon scripts to the addons folder. Add them to addons/core/AddonLoader.lua for your addons to load properly.
	- Client side scripts are unsupported due to security issues. Scripts will only execute serverside, or in Play Solo and/or Studio modes.
	- The old -script command line argument in NovetusCMD and the ClientScript variable %addonscriptpath% have both been removed to support this.
	- Look in the addons/Addon_Template.lua file for more info on how to create your addon script!
	- Addon Scripts that are pre-installed and loaded:
		- Utils - Prints the name of the currently running client and script in a Lighting object.
		- ShadersCompatibility - Allows 2007E, 2007M, 2006S and 2009E to connect to servers running alternate versions (Shaders, HD, etc) and vice versa.
		- ServerWhitelist - Makes it so users' tripcodes have to be added to a whitelist before joining a server. Disabled by default.
- 2008M no longer uses OpenGL Legacy as the default graphics mode.
- The Asset Fixer and Legacy Place Converter will now show errors when loading a binary format place/model.
- The Legacy Place Converter now can load RBXMX, RBXL, and RBXM file types.

- Addon Packages are now renamed to Mod Packages to make differentiating them from Addon Scripts easier.
- Added the Mod Package Creator! Create compressed .zip files of new items, maps, and more and share them with the community!
	- This adds a new file list file that gets created upon initial launcher bootup. Use the -nofilelist command line option to disable the launcher's file list creation if Novetus takes a while to load initially (will make the Mod Package Creator basically unusable).
- Made Master Server ping messages more verbose.
- Improved the stability of master server pings.
- The Master Server has been split into 2 files: list.php and delist.php
	- Backwards compatibility has been added for master servers only using query.php. Master Server owners should still move to the new list/delist.php system for optimal security.
- Each server now has a randomly generated ID that is only visible to the server host (in the console) and the master server host (in serverlist.txt)
	- IDs will become visible in the Console in some Novetus launcher styles and NovetusCMD.

Fixes:
- Made the initial Asset Fixer "Unable to fix the asset." error message more descriptive.

- Added a new default addon: the Server Whitelist!

- The Asset SDK's Asset Fixer now properly supports fixing the URLs inside of scripts.

	- As a result, T-Shirts with Roblox Asset URLs/Redirects will not load in 2007e.
- Added ClientScript Variables:
	- %tshirttexid%, %shirttexid%, %pantstexid%, %facetexid% - Returns the texture URL for the respective online clothing type. Returns nothing if the URL is invalid, the item isn't using Online Clothing, or %localizeonlineclothing% is not defined in the script.

Returns nothing if the URL is invalid, the item isn't using Online Clothing, or %localizeonlineclothing% is not defined in the script. Only the client who downloads the clothing would be able to see it. 
	- %localizeonlineclothing% - Grabs texture IDS for the %texid% variables and localizes the texture for the %texidlocal% variables. This WILL increase load times of your client depending on how many items are being downloaded.
	- %newgui% - Returns if the 2011L interface is enabled on 2011M clients. Can be used as a toggle switch for other client-side CoreScript features.
