INFORMATION
-------------------------------

[What is Novetus?]
​Novetus is a free and open source multi-version ROBLOX client launcher 
built to allow the user to run LAN and Internet servers.
						
Novetus was made as a successor to my old RBXLegacy project, 
with the addition of new features that enhance the launcher for mod development, 
player customization, and overall usability.

Novetus is based on RBXLegacy 1.16.2, however it uses some features from RBXLegacy 1.18,
such as extended customization, better layout, improved networking features, avatar
previewing, and more.

Enhancements from RBXLegacy The Final Update 1.16.2 & 1.18.1:
- Fully offline customization and wider customization options
- Enhanced 3D Avatar Preview
- An expanded SDK with many tools to use.
- Improved UPnP functionality
- Ability to reset server/client port to default
- Easier to read join tab note
- Better launcher and client security
- Sharing of customized players with other players.
- ClientScript scripting language for creating more customized client command arguments
- Better client support. (from March 2007 up to the latest ROBLOX client with ClientScript!)
- Custom client warnings
- Command arguments for different functions
- Many more items
- Redesigned launcher
- Largely reworked codebase
- Custom player icons
- A command-line utility for hosting servers.
- Addon support (Mod Packages and support for addon LUA scripts with a built in scripting API)
- 2006 Color presets!
- More character colors.
- Graphical Options menu with Automatic and Custom options.
- Online clothing support with customizable clothing providers.
- 3 styles; an Extended style for easy access to options, a Compact style resembling the original RBXLegacy, and a default Stylish style built for 
accessibility and nostalgic style.
- Lite version.
- Much more stable.

INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

WARNING: 
If Hamachi is on, you won't be able to join "localhost" or any other local or private IP address! In order to use Novetus on LAN, 
you must either turn off Hamachi by pressing the "Turn Off" button, or by turning one of your Hamachi networks online if you own a network.

NOTE:
Make sure the server you are trying to join is in your region of the world (I.E West US, East US, UK, etc), if it is not you may experience major network lag issues.
(i.e. if you are in Arizona and someone hosts a server in Florida, you will not have a fun time because it will lag a lot.)
If you have a problem where you can't see your character, REGENERATE YOUR PLAYER ID THEN REJOIN THE SERVER.
If you tried to connect to the server and you get an error, REJOIN THE SERVER.

--------------------------------

HOSTING
--------------------------------

How to host a server:

4. Select the "START SERVER" tab.
5. Select the name of the map you want to play, then press the "START SERVER" button. The Studio window should load with the map you chose.
6. To share your server with friends, send them your public/external IP address (Google ip).

2. Open the Novetus Launcher.
3. Select the client you want.
4. Select the "START SERVER" tab.
5. Select the name of the map you want to play, then press the "START SERVER" button. The Studio window should load with the map you chose.
6. To share your server with friends, tell them your LAN IPv4 address.

How to host a Hamachi server:

You must also share the network ID and password to your Hamachi network.

How to host a Playit.gg server:

1. Make sure you have Playit.gg installed and you set up a custom UDP tunnel for your server's port (from the OPTIONS tab) already. If you do not know how, there are plenty of tutorials on the internet for this.
2. Open the Novetus Launcher.
3. Select the client you want.
4. Select the "START SERVER" tab.
5. Select the name of the map you want to play, then press the "START SERVER" button. The Studio window should load with the map you chose.

How to host a Master server:

2. Install a web server like WAMPServer.
3. After installing it, start up the WAMPServer application. Wait until the "W" on your taskbar goes green.
4. Left click the "W", then click on the "www directory" option. Windows Explorer will load with a folder named "www".

5. Novetus will now set the image as your icon. You should now be able to see your icon on the server, however no one would be able to see it except you. 
For other people to see it, you need to share it to them and they would need to do this same process but use your name as the file name for the png if the name was changed.
